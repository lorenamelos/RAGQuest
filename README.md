# RAGQuest: Book Inquiry Engine using LangChain 🦜🔗

## Introduction
RAGNify is a Book Knowledge Portal that leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to provide users with efficient access to information from various books. The project features a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to ask questions about different books and receive answers generated by the **RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model.


## 👩‍💻	Personal Purpose
The primary personal purpose of the RAGNify Book Knowledge Portal is to serve as a showcase of my skills and expertise in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), Python programming, LangChain library, and other advanced technologies. By developing this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in building sophisticated natural language processing systems that leverage cutting-edge techniques to provide valuable services to users.

Additionally, I intend to highlight my ability to design and implement user-friendly interfaces, integrate diverse libraries and APIs seamlessly, and deliver comprehensive solutions that address real-world needs. This project not only showcases my technical capabilities but also reflects my passion for knowledge dissemination, education, and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language understanding.


## Key Features
- **Efficient Information Retrieval:** Users can quickly access information from books by asking questions.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** The portal supports multiple books, providing users with a wide range of literary works to inquire about.
- **Customizable Answer Length:** Users can specify the desired length of the answer summary.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using Streamlit, the portal offers an intuitive interface for easy interaction.
- **Integration of Advanced Technologies:** Utilizes LangChain library and LLM (Large Language Model) from OpenAI for advanced natural language processing.
- **Enhanced Research Capabilities:** Researchers, students, and enthusiasts can benefit from advanced search capabilities.
- **Educational Value:** Facilitates learning and knowledge acquisition by presenting information in a clear and concise manner.

## Installation
