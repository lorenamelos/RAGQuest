    <div style="text-align: justify">
    RAGNify is a web-based Book Knowledge Portal that leverages the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models
    for question answering. It integrates the LangChain library, which provides tools for natural language processing
    tasks, and utilizes the LLM OpenAI model for language generation and embedding.

            The primary personal purpose of the RAGNify Book Knowledge Portal is to serve as a showcase of my skills
            and expertise in utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), Python programming, LangChain library, and other
            advanced technologies. By developing this project, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in building sophisticated
            natural language processing systems that leverage cutting-edge techniques to provide valuable services to users.

            Additionally, I intend to highlight my ability to design and implement user-friendly interfaces, integrate
            diverse libraries and APIs seamlessly, and deliver comprehensive solutions that address real-world needs.
            This project not only showcases my technical capabilities but also reflects my passion for knowledge dissemination,
            education, and innovation in the field of artificial intelligence and natural language understanding.
